        AdventureCord is a turn-based RPG game played through a Discord bot of
        my creation. Users can create and delete characters, view their
        inventory, select classes, and participate in combat. The bot is built
        to store user data inside a database, as well as provide an engaging
        story and interactive combat system.

          <p>üêâ CURRENT RPG BOT FEATURES AS OF 04/21/25üßô :</p>
          <li>
            CREATE A CHARACTER‚öîÔ∏è : Players can create an adventurer to play as
            by typing "$create {name} {class}". The current classes to choose
            from are warrior, mage, tank, and peasant. You must type the class
            in lowercase. EX: "$create Kash warrior". Players are currently only
            allowed 1 player, so attempting to create a second character will
            not work at the moment.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            SEE THE FULL LIST OF ADVENTURERSüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è : Players can view the full list
            of adventurers by typing "$list"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            DELETE YOUR CHARACTER‚ùå : If you wanna choose a new name or class
            don't fear! I've implemented a delete feature you can access by
            typing "$delete". The bot will then ask you if you wish to delete
            your character in which you can either respond "yes" or "no". You
            can only use one of those two words to answer that question and you
            MUST TYPE IT IN LOWERCASE.
          </li>
