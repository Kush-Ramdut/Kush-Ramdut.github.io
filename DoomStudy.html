        DoomStudy is a web application designed to help users track, manage, and
        engage in their responsibilities. The main premise around this project
        was to give users a basic timer in which they could study or perform
        certain tasks in. When the timer finishes, the user will then be met
        with a form of media that displays their favorite videos so they could
        relax and recover before starting again.

          <li>
            STUDY TIMER: Users can set a timer for a specific duration to focus
            on their tasks. Once the timer ends, the webpage will make an API
            call to fetch a random video from YouTube based on the user's
            preferences.
          </li>

          <li>
            CREATE AND REVIEW FLASHCARDS : Users can create flashcards with
            questions and answers to aid in memorization. These flashcards will
            be stored in a data base and will be retrieved by unique user
            accounts.
          </li>

          <li>
            CREATE A CALENDAR : Users can create a calendar to keep track of
            important dates and deadlines. The calendar will be interactive and
            can appear on any page in the application.
